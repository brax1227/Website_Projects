# Website_Projects
This is a place for me to showcase the websites that I have designed (These were created completely for free and to display my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though I did collaborate with the clients of these websites, I did not charge for my work)
Not all of these were specifically made for a specific client, some of them are just exercises to showcase my general knowldge as well.
